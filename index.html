			<h4>What About Me?</h4>
			<p>Just a girl who grew up in the suburbs, didn't have much to do but be creative and use things that were available. I would just make things when ideas come to me. Which brought me here now. I am currently a student interested in advertising and branding. I love being creative and solving problems.</p>
			<h4>Into:</h4>
			<p>Advertising, "Because they sell things that people don't want."</p>
